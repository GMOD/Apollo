        <comment>Features can be arranged in graphs, e.g. "exon part_of transcript part_of gene"; If type is thought of as a verb, the each arc or edge makes a statement [Subject
        Verb Object]. The object can also be thought of as parent (containing feature), and subject as child (contained feature or subfeature). We include the relationship
        rank/order, because even though most of the time we can order things implicitly by sequence coordinates, we can not always do this - e.g. transpliced genes. It is also
        useful for quickly getting implicit introns.</comment>
