                If the synonym has been used publicly and deliberately (e.g. in a paper), it my also be listed in reports as a synonym. If the synonym was not used deliberately
                (e.g., there was a typo which went public), then the is_internal bit may be set to "true" so that it is known that the synonym is "internal" and should be
                queryable but should not be listed in reports as a valid synonym.</comment>
