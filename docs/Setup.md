# Setup guide


The quick-start guide showed how to quickly launch a temporary instance of Apollo, but deploying the application to
production normally involves some extra steps.


The general idea behind your deployment is to create a `apollo-config.groovy` file from some existing sample files which
have sample settings for various database engines.


## Pre-requisites

The server will minimally need to have Java 8 or greater, [Grails](https://grails.org/), [git](https://git-scm.com/),
[ant](http://ant.apache.org/), a servlet container e.g. [tomcat7+](http://tomcat.apache.org/), jetty, or resin. An
external database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL is generally used for production, but instructions for the H2 database is
also provided.

**Important note**:  The default memory for Tomcat and Jetty is insufficient to run Apollo (and most other web apps).   
You should [increase the memory according to these instructions](Troubleshooting.md#tomcat-memory).

Other possible [build settings for JBrowse](http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse_Configuration_Guide):
 
Ubuntu / Debian

     sudo apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev libexpat1-dev libpng-dev libgd2-noxpm-dev build-essential git python-software-properties python make
    
RedHat / CentOS

     sudo apt-get install zlib zlib-dev expat-dev libpng-dev libgd2-noxpm-dev build-essential git python-software-properties python make
     
     
It is recommended to use the [default version of JBrowse or better](https://github.com/GMOD/Apollo/blob/develop/grails-app/conf/Config.groovy#L406) (though it does not work with JBrowse 2 yet).

There are [additional requirements](Apollo2Build.md) if doing development with Apollo.

### Install node and yarn

Node versions 6-12 have been tested and work.   [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and ``nvm install 8``` is recommended.

    npm install -g yarn

### Install jdk
     
Build settings for Apollo specifically.  Recent versions of tomcat7 will work, though tomcat 8 and 9 are preferred.  If it does not install automatically there are a number of ways to [build tomcat on linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-get-on-ubuntu-16-04):
     
    sudo apt-get install ant openjdk-8-jdk 
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/  # or set in .bashrc / .profile / .zshrc
    export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8` # OR

    
If you need to have multiple versions of java (note [#2222](https://github.com/GMOD/Apollo/issues/2222)), you will need to specify the version for tomcat.  In tomcat8 on Ubuntu you'll need to set the `/etc/default/tomcat8` file JAVA_HOME explicitly:

    JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64

Download Apollo from the [latest release](https://github.com/GMOD/Apollo/releases/latest/) under source-code and unzip.  
Test installation by running ```./apollo run-local``` and see that the web-server starts up on http://localhost:8080/apollo/.  
To setup for production continue onto configuration below after install . 


### Database configuration

Apollo supports several database backends, and you can choose sample configurations from using H2, Postgres, or
MySQL by default.

Each has a file called `sample-h2-apollo-config.groovy` or `sample-postgres-apollo-config.groovy` that is designed to be
renamed to apollo-config.groovy before running `apollo deploy`.   Additionally, you can also run via [docker](Docker.md).


Furthermore, the `apollo-config.groovy` has different groovy environments for test, development, and production modes.
The environment will be selected automatically selected depending on how it is run, e.g:

* `apollo deploy` use the production environment (i.e. when you copy the war file to your production
server `apollo run-local` or `apollo debug` use the development environment (i.e. when you are running it locally)
* `apollo test` uses the test environment (i.e. only when running unit tests)


#### Configure for H2:
- H2 is an embedded database engine, so no external setups are needed. Simply copy sample-h2-apollo-config.groovy to
  apollo-config.groovy.
    - The default dev environment (`apollo run-local` or `apollo run-app`) is in memory so you will have to change that to file.
- If you use H2 with tomcat or jetty in production you have to set the permissions for the file path in production correctly (e.g. `jdbc:h2:/mypath/prodDb`, `chown -u tomcat:tomcat /mypath/prodDb.*.db`).
    - If you use the local relative path `jdbc:h2:./prodDb` and tomcat8 the path will likely be: `/usr/share/tomcat8/prodDb*db`

#### Configure for PostgreSQL:
- Create a new database with postgres and add a user for production mode.  Here are [a few ways to do this in PostgreSQL](PostgreSQLSetup.md).
- Copy the sample-postgres-apollo-config.groovy to apollo-config.groovy. 


#### Configure for MySQL:
- Create a new MySQL database for production mode (i.e. run ``create database `apollo-production``` in the mysql
  console) and copy the sample-postgres-apollo-config.groovy to apollo-config.groovy.


#### Apollo in Galaxy
Apollo can always be used externally from Galaxy, but there are a few integrations available as well.

- [Using Docker compose](https://github.com/GMOD/docker-compose-galaxy-annotation).
- [From the Test Toolshed](https://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/eric-rasche/apollo/df7a90763b3c).
- [Using the Galaxy Genome Annotation Toolsuite](https://github.com/galaxy-genome-annotation/docker-galaxy-genome-annotation).

### Database schema

After you startup the application, the database schema (tables, etc.) is automatically setup. You don't have to
initialize any database schemas yourself.

## Deploy the application

The `apollo run-local` command only launches a temporary server and should really not be used in production, so to
deploy to production, we build a new WAR file with the `apollo deploy` command. After you have setup your
`apollo-config.groovy` file, and it has the appropriate username, password, and JDBC URL in it, then we can run the
command:

``` 
./apollo deploy
```


This command will package the application and it will download any missing pre-requisites (jbrowse) into a WAR file in
the "target/" subfolder. After it completes, you can then copy the WAR file (e.g. ```apollo-2.0.4.war```) from the target folder
to the ```web-app``` folder of your [web container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_container#open_source_Web_containers) installation.
If you name the file ```apollo.war``` in your webapps folder, then you can access your app at "http://localhost:8080/apollo"

We test primarily on [Apache Tomcat (7.0.62+ and 8)](http://tomcat.apache.org/).  **Make sure to [set your Tomcat memory](https://github.com/GMOD/Apollo/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md#tomcat-memory) to an appropriate size or Apollo will run slow / crash.**



Alternatively, as we alluded to previously, you can also launch a temporary instance of the server which is useful for
testing

``` 
./apollo run-local 8085
```

This temporary server will be accessible at "http://localhost:8085/apollo"

### Tomcat configuration

If you have tracks that have deep nested features that will result in a feature JSON larger than 10MB or if you have a client
 that sends requests to the Apollo server as JSON of size larger than 10MB then you will have to modify `src/war/templates/web.xml`.

Specifically the following block in `web.xml`:
```
    <context-param>
        <param-name>org.apache.tomcat.websocket.textBufferSize</param-name>
        <param-value>10000000</param-value>
    </context-param>
    <context-param>
        <param-name>org.apache.tomcat.websocket.binaryBufferSize</param-name>
        <param-value>10000000</param-value>
    </context-param>
```

Note: The `<param-value>` is in bytes.

### Memory configuration

Changing the memory used by Apollo in production must be [configured within Tomcat directly](Troubleshooting#tomcat-memory).

The default memory assigned to Apollo to run commands in Apollo is 2048 MB. This can be changed in your
`apollo-config.groovy` by uncommenting the memory configuration block:

```
// Uncomment to change the default memory configurations
grails.project.fork = [
        test   : false,
        // configure settings for the run-app JVM
        run    : [maxMemory: 2048, minMemory: 64, debug: false, maxPerm: 1024, forkReserve: false],
        // configure settings for the run-war JVM
        war    : [maxMemory: 2048, minMemory: 64, debug: false, maxPerm: 1024, forkReserve: false],
        // configure settings for the Console UI JVM
        console: [maxMemory: 2048, minMemory: 64, debug: false, maxPerm: 1024]
]
```

### Note on database settings

If you use the `apollo run-local` command, then the "development" section of the apollo-config.groovy is used (or an
temporary in-memory H2 database is used if no apollo-config.groovy exists).

If you use the WAR file generated by the `apollo deploy` command on your own webserver, then the "production" section of
the apollo-config.groovy is used.

## Detailed build instructions


While the shortcut `apollo deploy` takes care of basic application deployment, understanding the full build process of
Apollo can help you to optimize and improve your deployed instances.
