## Apollo Configuration


Apollo includes some basic configuration parameters that are specified in configuration files. The most important
parameters are the database parameters in order to get Apollo up and running. Other options besides the database
parameters can be configured via the config files, but note that many parameters can also be configured via the web
interface.

Note: Configuration options may change over time, as more configuration items are integrated into the web interface.


### Main configuration

The main configuration settings for Apollo are stored in `grails-app/conf/Config.groovy`, but you can override settings
in your `apollo-config.groovy` file (i.e. the same file that contains your database parameters). Here are the defaults
that are defined in the Config.groovy file:

``` 
// default apollo settings
apollo {
    gff3.source = "." // also for GPAD
    // other translation codes are of the form ncbi_KEY_translation_table.txt
    // under the web-app/translation_tables  directory
    // to add your own add them to that directory and over-ride the translation code here
    get_translation_code = 1
   
    proxies = [
            [
                    referenceUrl : 'http://golr.geneontology.org/select',
                    targetUrl    : 'http://golr.geneontology.org/solr/select',
                    active       : true,
                    fallbackOrder: 0,
                    replace      : true
            ]
            ,
            [
                    referenceUrl : 'http://golr.geneontology.org/select',
                    targetUrl    : 'http://golr.berkeleybop.org/solr/select',
                    active       : false,
                    fallbackOrder: 1,
                    replace      : false
            ]
    ]
    fa_to_twobit_exe = "/usr/local/bin/faToTwoBit" // get from https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/blatSpec.html
    sequence_search_tools = [
            blat_nuc : [
                    search_exe  : "/usr/local/bin/blat",
                    search_class: "org.bbop.apollo.sequence.search.blat.BlatCommandLineNucleotideToNucleotide",
                    name        : "Blat nucleotide",
                    params      : ""
            ],
            blat_prot: [
                    search_exe  : "/usr/local/bin/blat",
                    search_class: "org.bbop.apollo.sequence.search.blat.BlatCommandLineProteinToNucleotide",
                    name        : "Blat protein",
                    params      : ""
                    //tmp_dir: "/opt/apollo/tmp" optional param
            ]
    ]
    ...
}
```

These settings are essentially the same familiar parameters from a config.xml file from previous Apollo versions.  The
defaults are generally sufficient, but as noted above, you can override any particular parameter in your
`apollo-config.groovy` file, e.g. you can add override configuration any given parameter as follows:

``` 
grails {
  apollo.get_translation_code = 1
  apollo {
    use_cds_for_new_transcripts = true
    default_minimum_intron_size = 1
    get_translation_code = 1  // identical to the dot notation
  }
}
```

### Count annotations

By default annotations are counted, but in some cases this can be come prohibitive for performance if a lot of annotations. 
This can be shut off by setting this to false.  This can over-ridden as below in the `apollo-config.groovy` file:

```
grails {
  apollo.count_annotations = false
  apollo {
    count_annotations = false
  }
}
```



### JBrowse Plugins and Configuration

You can configure the installed Apollo JBrowse by modifying the `jbrowse` section of your ```apollo-config.groovy``` that overrides the JBrowse [configuration file](https://github.com/GMOD/Apollo/blob/develop/grails-app/conf/Config.groovy).

There are two sections, ```plugins``` and ```git```, which specifies the JBrowse version.

```
 git {
        url = "https://github.com/gmod/jbrowse"
        branch = "1.16.8-release"
```
   
If a git block a ```tag``` or ```branch``` can be specified.  

In the ```plugins``` section, options are ```included``` (part of the JBrowse release), ```url``` (requiring a url parameter), 
or ```git```, which can include a ```tag``` or ```branch``` as above.  

Options for ```alwaysRecheck``` and ```alwaysRepull``` always check the branch and tag and always pull respectiviely. 

See `sample-*.groovy` for example sections: https://github.com/GMOD/Apollo/blob/develop/sample-h2-apollo-config.groovy#L112-L146


### Translation tables


The default translation table is [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi#SG1) 

To use a different table from [this list of NCBI translation tables](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi) set the number in the ```apollo-config.groovy``` file as:

```
apollo {
...
  get_translation_code = "11"
```   

You may also add a custom translation table in the ```web-app/translation_tables``` directory as follows:

```
web-app/translation_tables/ncbi_customname_translation_table.txt
```

Specify the ```customname``` in apollo-config.groovy as follows:

```
apollo {
...
  get_translation_code = "customname"
}
```

As well, translation tables can be set per organism using the _'Details'_ panel located in the _'Organism'_ tab of the Annotator panel in the Apollo window: to replace the translation table (default or set by admin) for any given organism, use the field labeled as _'Non-default Translation Table'_ to enter a different table identifier as needed. 


### Configuring Transcript Overlapper

Apollo, by default, uses a `CDS` overlapper which treats two overlapping transcripts as isoforms of each other if and only if they share the same in-frame CDS.

You can also configure Apollo to use an `exon` overlapper, which would treat two overlapping transcripts as isoforms of each other if one or more exon overlaps with each other they share the same splice acceptor and splice donor sites.

```
apollo {
    transcript_overlapper = "exon"
}
```


### Logging configuration

To over-ride the default logging, you can look at the logging configurations from
[Config.groovy](https://github.com/GMOD/Apollo/blob/master/grails-app/conf/Config.groovy) and override or modify them in
`apollo-config.groovy`.

``` 
log4j.main = {
    error 'org.codehaus.groovy.grails.web.servlet',  // controllers
          'org.codehaus.groovy.grails.web.pages',    // GSP
          'org.codehaus.groovy.grails.web.sitemesh', // layouts
           ...
    warn 'grails.app'
}
```

To add debug-level logging you would replace `warn 'grails.app'` with two lines `debug 'grails.app'` and `debug 'org.bbop.apollo'`.  To see database-level logging you would also add: `trace 'org.hibernate.type'` and `debug 'org.hibernate.SQL'`.

- Grails log4j guide: http://grails.github.io/grails-doc/2.4.x/guide/single.html#logging

### Add attribute for the original id of the object

In the apollo `store_orig_id=true` is set to true by default.  To store an `orid_id` attribute on the top-level feature that 
represents the original id from the genomic evidence.  This is useful for re-merging code as Apollo will generate its own IDs because 
annotations will be based on multiple evidence sources.  To turn this off, override it by setting it to false `store_orig_id = false`.


### Canned Elements


Canned comments, canned keys (tags), and canned values are configured using the Admin tab from the Annotator Panel on the web interface; these can no longer be created or edited using the configuration files. For more details on how to create and edit Canned Elements see [Canned Elements](CannedElements.md).

View your instances page for more details. For example 
- http://localhost:8080/apollo/cannedComment/  
- http://localhost:8080/apollo/cannedKey/ 
- http://localhost:8080/apollo/cannedValue/


### Search tools

Apollo can be configured to work with various sequence search tools. UCSC's BLAT tool is configured by default and you
can customize it as follows by making modifications in the ```apollo-config.groovy``` file.  Here we replace blat with blast 
(there is an existing wrapper for Blast).  The database for each file will be passed in via params (globally) or using the 
```Blat database``` field in the organism tab.  For blast the database will be the root name of the blast database files 
without the suffix.   Retrieve [blat binaries from ucsc](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/blatSpec.html).

``` 
apollo{
    fa_to_twobit_exe = "/usr/local/bin/faToTwoBit" // get from https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/blatSpec.html
	sequence_search_tools {
        blat_nuc {
            search_exe = "/usr/local/bin/blastn"
            search_class = "org.bbop.apollo.sequence.search.blast.BlastCommandLine"
            name = "Blast nucleotide"
            params = ""
        }
        blat_prot {
            search_exe = "/usr/local/bin/tblastn"
            search_class = "org.bbop.apollo.sequence.search.blast.BlastCommandLine"
            name = "Blast protein to translated nucleotide"
            params = ""
            //tmp_dir: "/opt/apollo/tmp" optional param
        }
        your_custom_search_tool {
          search_exe = "/usr/local/customtool"
          search_class = "org.your.custom.Class"
          name: "Custom search"
        }
    }
}

```

When you setup your organism in the web interface, you can then enter the location of the sequence search database for
BLAT.  

If you setup `fa_to_twobit_exe` with the proper path, fasta uploads for new genomes will automatically be indexed and populated.

Note: If the BLAT binaries reside elsewhere on your system, edit the search_exe location in the config to point to your
BLAT executable.

### Data adapters


Data adapters for Apollo provide the methods for exporting annotation data from the application. By default, GFF3
and FASTA adapters are supplied. They are configured to query your IOService URL e.g.
http://localhost:8080/apollo/IOService with the customizable query

``` 
data_adapters = [[
  permission: 1,
  key: "GFF3",
  data_adapters: [[
    permission: 1,
    key: "Only GFF3",
    options: "output=file&format=gzip&type=GFF3&exportGff3Fasta=false"
  ],
  [
    permission: 1,
    key: "GFF3 with FASTA",
    options: "output=file&format=gzip&type=GFF3&exportGff3Fasta=true"
  ]]
],
[
  permission: 1,
  key : "FASTA",
  data_adapters :[[
    permission : 1,
    key : "peptide",
    options : "output=file&format=gzip&type=FASTA&seqType=peptide"
  ],
  [
    permission : 1,
    key : "cDNA",
    options : "output=file&format=gzip&type=FASTA&seqType=cdna"
  ],
  [
    permission : 1,
    key : "CDS",
    options : "output=file&format=gzip&type=FASTA&seqType=cds"
  ]]
]]
```

#### Default data adapter options

The options available for the data adapters are configured as follows

- type: `GFF3` or `FASTA`
- output: can be `file` or `text`. `file` exports to a file and provides a UUID link for downloads, text just outputs to
  stream.
- format: can by `gzip` or `plain`. `gzip` offers gzip compression of the exports, which is the default.
- exportSequence: `true` or `false`, which is used to include FASTA sequence at the bottom of a GFF3 export


### Supported annotation types

Many configurations will require you to define which annotation types the configuration will apply to. Apollo supports
the following "higher level" types (from the Sequence Ontology):

* sequence:gene
* sequence:pseudogene
* sequence:transcript
* sequence:mRNA
* sequence:tRNA
* sequence:snRNA
* sequence:snoRNA
* sequence:ncRNA
* sequence:rRNA
* sequence:miRNA
* sequence:repeat_region
* sequence:transposable_element

### Set the default biotype for dragging up evidence

By default dragged up evidence is treated as `mRNA`. However, you can specify the default biotype within `trackList.json` in order to specify default types for tracks.

For example, specifying `ncRNA` as the default type:

```
{
    'key' : 'Official Gene Set v3.2 Canvas',
    'storeClass' : 'JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/NCList',
    'urlTemplate' : 'tracks/Official Gene Set v3.2/{refseq}/trackData.json',
    'default_biotype':'ncRNA'
}
```

If you specify `auto` instead then it will automatically try to infer based on a feature's type.

Other non-transcript types `repeat_region` and `transposable_element` are also supported.


### Apache / Nginx configuration

Oftentimes, admins will put use Apache or Nginx as a reverse proxy so that the requests to a main server can be
forwarded to the tomcat server.  This setup is not necessary, but it is a very standard configuration as is making modification to iptables.  

Note that we use the SockJS library, which will downgrade to long-polling if websockets are not available, but since
websockets are preferable, it helps to take some extra steps to ensure that the websocket calls are proxied or forwarded
in some way too.  Using Tomcat 8 or above is recommended.

If using a separate Oauth2 provider, a more [detailed example of handling both the proxy and the authentication with OpenID Connect](OpenIDConnectAuthentication.md) has also been provided.


### Installing secure certificates. 

Free certificates can be found by using [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).

Follow the instructions to install your appropriate certificate if users are going to potentially be sending passwords across. 


#### Apache Proxy 

Here is the most basic configuration for a reverse proxy with Apache 2.4 (will probably work for 2.2 as well).   

Enable proxy_pass and proxy_wstunnel:

    sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_wstunnel proxy_connect proxy_http
    sudo service apache2 restart

In the apache conf directory edit `proxy.conf`

``` 
   <Proxy *>
      # if using Apache 2.2 use Order, Allow directives
      Order Deny,Allow
      Allow from all

      # if using Apache 2.4 use Require directive
      Require all granted

    </Proxy>
    
    ProxyPass /apollo/stomp/info http://localhost:8080/apollo/stomp/info
    ProxyPassReverse /apollo/stomp/info http://localhost:8080/apollo/stomp/info

    ProxyPass /apollo/stomp ws://localhost:8080/apollo/stomp
    ProxyPassReverse /apollo/stomp ws://localhost:8080/apollo/stomp

    ProxyPass           /apollo  http://localhost:8080/apollo
    ProxyPassReverse    /apollo  http://localhost:8080/apollo

```

### If Tomcat is running SSL 

If the secure certificate is on Apollo and you're running via apache use `https` and `wss` protocols instead or just change the tomcat server port explicitly:

```
    ProxyPass /apollo/stomp/info https://site:8443/apollo/stomp/info
    ProxyPassReverse /apollo/stomp/info https://localhost:8443/apollo/stomp/info

    ProxyPass /apollo/stomp wss://localhost:8443/apollo/stomp
    ProxyPassReverse /apollo/stomp wss://localhost:8443/apollo/stomp

    ProxyPass           /apollo  https://localhost:8443/apollo
    ProxyPassReverse    /apollo  https://localhost:8443/apollo

```



Note: that a reverse proxy _does not_ use `ProxyRequests On` (which turns on forward proxying, which is dangerous)

Also note: This setup will downgrade (but will still function) to use AJAX long-polling without the websocket proxy being configured.




##### Debugging proxy issues

Note: if your webapp is accessible but it doesn't seem like you can login, you may need to customize the
ProxyPassReverseCookiePath

For example, if you proxied to a different path, you might have something like this

``` 
ProxyPass  /testing http://localhost:8080
ProxyPassReverse  /testing http://localhost:8080
ProxyPassReverseCookiePath / /testing
```

Then your application might be accessible from http://localhost/testing/apollo


#### Nginx Proxy (from version 1.4 on)

Your setup may vary, but setting the upgrade headers can be used for the websocket configuration
http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/websocket.html

``` 
    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default upgrade;
        ''      close;
    }
    
    server {
        # Main
        listen   80; server_name  myserver;
        
        # http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/websocket.html
        location /ApolloSever {
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
            proxy_pass      http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        }
    }
```

### Adding extra tabs

Extra tabs can be added to the side panel by over-riding the apollo configuration extraTabs:

```
    extraTabs = [
            ['title': 'extra1', 'url': 'http://localhost:8080/apollo/annotator/report/'],
            ['title': 'extra2', 'content': '<b>Apollo</b> documentation <a href="http://genomearchitect.org" target="_blank">linked here</a>']
    ]

```


### Upgrading existing instances

There are several scripts for migrating from older instances. See the [migration guide](Migration.md) for details.
Particular notes:

Note: Apollo does not require using the `add-webapollo-plugin.pl` because the plugin is loaded implicitly by
including the client/apollo/json/annot.json file at run time.

#### Upgrading existing JBrowse data stores

It is not necessary to change your existing JBrowse data directories to use Apollo 2.x, you can just point to existing
data directories from your previous instances.

More information about [JBrowse](http://jbrowse.org/) can also be found in their [FAQ](http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse_FAQ).

#### Adding custom CSS for track styling for JBrowse

There are a variety of different ways to include new CSS into the browser, but the easiest might be the following


Add the following statement to your trackList.json:

``` 
    "css" : "data/yourfile.css"
```


Then just place your CSS file in your organism's data directory.

##### Adding custom CSS globally for JBrowse

If you want to add CSS that is used globally for JBrowse, you can edit the CSS in the client/apollo/css folder, but
since you need to re-deploy the app every time for updates, it is easier to just edit the data directories for your
organisms (you do not need to re-deploy the app when you are editing organism specific data, since this is outside of
the webapp directory and is not deployed with the WAR file)


#### Adding custom CSS globally for the GWT app


If you want to style the GWT sidebar, generally the bootstrap theme is used but extra CSS is also included from
web-app/annotator/theme.css which overrides the bootstrap theme


#### Adding / using proxies

If you are https, or choose to use separate services rather than the default provided, you can setup a pass-through proxy or modify a particular URL. 

This service is only available to logged-in users. 

The internal proxy URL is: 

```<apollo url>/proxy/request/<encoded_proxy_url>/```

For example if your URL the URL we want to proxy:

```http://golr.geneontology.org/solr/select```

encoded:

```http%3A%2F%2Fgolr.geneontology.org%2Fsolr%2Fselect```

If you user is logged-in and you pass in:

```http://localhost/apollo/proxy/request/http%3A%2F%2Fgolr.geneontology.org%2Fsolr%2Fselect?testkey=asdf&anotherkey=zxcv```

This will get proxied to:

```http://golr.geneontology.org/solr/select?testkey=asdf&anotherkey=zxcv```

If you choose to use another proxy service, you can go to the "Proxy" page (as administrator). 
Internally used proxies are provided by default. 
The order the final URL is chosen in is 'active' and then 'fallbackOrder'.  

### Register admin in configuration

If you want to register your admin user in the configuration, you can add a section to your ```apollo-config.groovy``` like:

    apollo{
    // other stuff
        admin{
            username = "super@duperadmin.com"
            password = System.getenv("APOLLO_ADMIN_PASSWORD")?:"demo"
            firstName = "Super"
            lastName = "Admin"
        }
    }
    
It should only add the user a single time.    User details can be retrieved from passed in text or from the environment depending on user preference.  

Admin users will be added on system startup.  Duplicate additions will be ignored.

### Other authentication strategies

By default Apollo uses a username / password to authenticate users.   However, additional strategies may be used.   

To configure them, add them to the ```apollo-config.groovy``` and set active to true for the ones you want to use to
 authenticate.

    apollo{
        // other stuff
        authentications = [
            ["name":"Username Password Authenticator",
             "className":"usernamePasswordAuthenticatorService",
             "active":true,
            ]
            ,
            ["name":"Remote User Authenticator",
             "className":"remoteUserAuthenticatorService",
             "active":false,
             "params":["default_group": "annotators"]
            ]
        ]
    }

The `Username Password Authenticator` is the default method for storing username passwords, where databases are stored secured within the database.  

The `Remote User Authentication` method uses a separate Apache authorization proxy, which is used by [the Galaxy Community](https://galaxyproject.org/admin/config/apache-external-user-auth/).   
Furthermore, users and groups can be inserted / updated via [web services](Web_services.md), which are wrapped by the [Apollo python library](https://pypi.org/project/apollo/). 
The `default_group` parameter adds a user to a default group on login so that a user has access to at least some genomes.  

A [more detailed guide using OpenIDConnect authorization](OpenIDConnectAuthentication.md) explains usage of both the proxy and an authentication strategy.


### URL modifications

You should be able to pass in most JBrowse URL modifications to the ```loadLink``` URL. 

You should use ```tracklist=1``` to force showing the native tracklist (or use the checkbox in the Track Tab in the Annotator Panel).

Use ```openAnnotatorPanel=0``` to close the Annotator Panel explicitly on startup. 


### Setting default track list behavior

By default the native tracklist is off, but can be added.  For new users if you want the default to be on, you can add this to the apollo-config.groovy:

    apollo{
       native_track_selector_default_on = true
    }

### Set Common Data Directory in the config

The `common_data_directory` is where uploaded and processed jbrowse tracks will go. 

This should be server-writable space on your system that is not deleted (note `/tmp` is deleted periodically on most unix systems). 

    common_data_directory = "/opt/temporary/apollo"

If you don't plan to use these features, then `/tmp` might be fine.  

In general it will create a directory for you at `$HOME/apollo_data` if not otherwise specified or will allow you to set one from the command-line.

### Adding tracks via addStores

The [JBrowse Configuration Guide](http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse_Configuration_Guide#addStores) describes in detail on how to add tracks to JBrowse using addStores.
The configuration relies on sending track config JSON through the URL which can be problematic, especially with new versions of Tomcat.

Instead we recommend using the dot notation to add track configuration through the URL.

Thus,
```
addStores={"uniqueStoreName":{"type":"JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/GFF3","urlTemplate":"url/of/my/file.gff3"}}
```

becomes,
```
addStores.uniqueStoreName.type=JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/GFF3&addStores.uniqueStoreName.urlTemplate=url/of/my/file.gff3
```


Following are a few recommendations for adding tracks via dot notation in Apollo:

- avoid `{dataRoot}` in your `urlTemplate`
- avoid specifying `data` folder name in your `urlTemplate`
- avoid specifying `baseUrl`

Since Apollo is aware of the organism data folder, specifying it explicitly in the `urlTemplate` can cause issues with URL redirects.

### Setting Track Style by type

For the default track type (`FeatureTrack`) to set the feature style by type (for example, if you have multiple feature types on a single track and you want to distinguish them,
 you have to set the track `className` as `{type}` in the style section of the `trackList.json` file for that track:

```
 
 "style": {
        "className": "{type}",
      },
```      

You then have to specify a custom CSS file for that type in the `trackList.json`:

 `"css":"data/custom.css"`
 
And that file has to go at the same level as `trackList.json`.
 
An example CSS entry to specify the feature type `lnc_RNA` might be:

```
 .minus-lnc_RNA .neat-UTR,
 .plus-lnc_RNA .neat-UTR,
 .lnc_RNA .neat-UTR{
         height: 12px;
         margin-top: 2px;
         color: rgb(200,2,3);
         background-color: rgb(5,4,255) !important;

### Hiding JBrowse tracks from the public

To hide public tracks from public organisms add `apollo.permission.level.private` line to your JBrowse track:

```
      {
         "compress" : 0,
         "key" : "GeneData_hidden",
         "label" : "GeneData_hidden",
         "storeClass" : "JBrowse/Store/SeqFeature/NCList",
         ... 
         "apollo":{
             "permission":{
                 "level":"private"
             }
         },
         ... 
         "trackType" : null,
         "type" : "FeatureTrack",
         "urlTemplate" : "tracks/GeneData/{refseq}/trackData.json"
      },
```

### Phone Home

In order to determine our usage and the current versions of Apollo being used (which helps us to provide Apollo for free), the server and the client will phone home and to google analytics.

To turn off the server phone home set the configuration this way.
    
    apollo.phone.phoneHome = false
    
To add your own google analytics code set the code up this way:

    google_analytics = ["UA-62921593-1","Your Google Analytics ID"]
    
If you don't want any reporting set:
    
    google_analytics = []


### Only owners can edit

Restricts deletion and reverting to original editor or admin user by setting:

    apollo.only_owners_delete = true
