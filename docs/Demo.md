# Demo

<b>Please use our [Demo Server](http://demo.genomearchitect.io/Apollo2/) with demo@demo.com / demo at login to play around with our features.  Annotations are routinely removed so go wild.</b>

Then, click on the "Ref Sequence" tab from the panel on the right to choose a Group to display. You can choose one of the Groups visible in the list, or you may type the name of the name of the Group in the "Search" box (for example: Group16.4 Group1.37; these groups have many gene models to get you started). You may now start annotating! Once you have displayed the first group, you may also choose to switch to a different Group from the drop-down menu in the navigation bar (e.g. Group1.10 Group1.33).

If you would like to also experience the "administrator user" please send us a request by email to the [Apollo Developers Team](mailto:apollo-dev@lists.lbl.gov).


The "Ref Sequence" selection panel on the right allows you to view all available reference sequences (e.g. scaffolds, groups, chromosomes, etc) and conduct bulk operations on those sequences (for example: exporting data).

You can choose a different organism from the drop-down menu on the upper left corner of the annotator panel. Please be aware you have access to the following organisms: Honeybee, Human-hg38, Yeast, and Volvox Fictious (the JBrowse demonstration sample organism). Choosing any of the other available options will show an error warning alerting you that you do not have sufficient permissions to perform the operation. Should you encounter this error, simply return to one of the organisms listed above.

If you are new to Apollo, we recommend that you read through our [User Guide](UsersGuide.md) to learn more about the software and its functionality.

Please Note: We have not tested the current version of Apollo on Internet Explorer. If you are not able to use Apollo on IE, you will need to use a different browser such as [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) (both available free of cost).

Happy Annotating!
