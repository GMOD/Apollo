# Command line tools

The command line tools offer a number of interesting features that can be used to help setup and retrieve data from the
application.


## Overview


The command line tools are located in docs/web_services/examples, and they are mostly small scripts that automate the
usage of the the web services API.

### get_gff3.groovy

Example:

``` 
get_gff3.groovy -organism Amel_4.5 -username admin@webapollo.com \
    -password admin_password -url http://localhost:8080/apollo > my output.gff3
```
This command can accept an -output argument to output to file, or the stdout can be redirected.

The -username and -password can be specified via the command line or if omitted, the user will be prompted.

### get_fasta.groovy

Example:

``` 
get_fasta.groovy -organism Amel_4.5 -username admin@webapollo.com \                                                      
    -password admin_password -seqtype cds/cdna/peptide -url http://localhost:8080/apollo > output.fa
```
This command can accept an -output argument to output to file, or the stdout can be redirected.   

The -username and -password can be specified via the command line (similar to `get_gff3.groovy`) or if omitted, the user
will be prompted.

The -seqtype parameter can be "cds", "cdna", or "peptide"

### add_users.groovy


Example:

``` 
add_users.groovy -username admin@webapollo.com -password admin_password \
    -newuser newuser@test.com -newpassword newuserpass \
    -destinationurl http://localhost:8080/apollo
```

The -username and -password refer to the admin user, and they can also be specified via stdin instead of the command
line if they are omitted.

A list of users specified in a csv file can also be used as input.

### add_organism.groovy


Example:

``` 
add_organism.groovy -name yeast -url http://localhost:8080/apollo/ \
    -directory /opt/apollo/yeast -username admin@webapollo.com -password admin_password
```


The -directory refers to the jbrowse data directory containing the output from prepare-refseqs.pl, flatfile-to-json.pl,
etc. The -blatdb is optional, -genus, and -species are optional.

The -username and -password refer to the admin user, and they can also be specified via stdin instead of the command
line if they are omitted.


### delete_annotations_from_organism.groovy

Example:

```
docs/web_services/examples/groovy/delete_annotations_from_organism.groovy  -destinationurl http://localhost:8080/apollo\
     -organismname honeybee2
```

This script will delete any annotations associated with a given organism.



### delete_organism.groovy

Example:

```
docs/web_services/examples/groovy/delete_organism.groovy  -url http://localhost:8080/apollo\
     -organism honeybee -username admin@webapollo.com -password admin_password
```

This script can be used to delete all organism information including the annotations from it.

The -username and -password refer to the admin user, and they can also be specified via stdin instead of the command
line if they are omitted.
