Developer guide
===============

View On GitHub

In the `build guide <Build.md>`__ we discussed briefly how to create a
build package. If you are a developer and have a custom setup of
WebApollo or JBrowse, then you can use this guide to compile your own
release package.

Pre-requisites for developers
-----------------------------

You will need the system `pre-requisites <Prerequisites.md>`__ as well
as some some additional dependencies for the javascript compilation
(NodeJS).

The easiest way to get NodeJS on ubuntu is nodejs-legacy. On centos,
it's easiest to use npm in the epel-release repository.

::

    # install nodejs (debian/ubuntu)
    sudo apt-get install git nodejs-legacy
    # install nodejs (centOS/redhat)
    sudo yum install epel-release
    sudo yum install git npm
    # install nodejs (macOSX/homebrew)
    brew install node

We will also need two extra perl packages to run the build

Ant based compilation of the client-side code
---------------------------------------------

The current preferred method for building a release is using the apollo
script

::

    apollo release

This will automatically call javascript minimization scripts and create
a release package of jbrowse in src/main/webapp/jbrowse and the compiled
WAR file in target/apollo-1.0.2.war (for example).

If you make changes to the javascript, you will probably need to delete
src/main/webapp/jbrowse and recompile the release with "apollo release".
Other changes can be simply updated using "apollo deploy" which will
update the war file.

Makefile based compilation of the client-side code
--------------------------------------------------

As an alternative to the ant/maven workflow, Web Apollo client side code
can be compiled using the Makefile which can be used for multiple Web
Apollo deployments. Example:

::

    make -f build/Makefile create-precompiled

This step will do the following

-  Clean any old builds
-  Download jbrowse from github
-  Compile and minimize the JBrowse and WebApollo javascript files
-  Output two packages, a release and debug package

Note: you can set your own JBrowse repo using JBROWSE\_GIT\_DIRECTORY on
the command line if you don't want the Makefile to download jbrowse,
e.g.:

::

    make -f build/Makefile create-precompiled JBROWSE_GIT_DIRECTORY=/home/devel/jbrowse_repo/

This will use your custom jbrowse repository instead of taking the
default action of cloning from
`https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse.git <http://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse.git>`__.

Once the client is compiled, you can use ``apollo deploy`` or
``apollo run`` to complete the custom build. See the `build
guide <Build.md>`__ for more details.
